# mernPrac
This repository is made for my own practice building mern stack. I was intend to practice how to set up backend and how to add necessary middlewares, database(mongodb).
Also wanted to practice communication environment between client and server. 
So i used react to build frontend, used redux for managing global state, used axios to send http request to backend i had built(used axios inside of redux's reducer function to send and change state), used express to build routing, set up middleware, make connection to database for backend, and used mongodob as database.
